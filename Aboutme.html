    <h2 class="headings"> Career </h2>
    <p> My current career is as a union carpenter. In August I broke my neck at work and in November had a spinal fusion. I am looking to return </p>
    <p> to work in April when I am healed. Due to the nature of concrete work, I am moving towards a degree in computer science.This career will be </p>
    <p> kinder to my body, mind and better for my sons home life. I am excited to see where it takes me. The transition has had some obstacles since</p>
    <p> it the aarena is very different, but I am enjoying everything about the new knowledge.</p>

    <h2 class="headings"> Location</h2>
    <p> I live in washington state. I reside specifically in the Pacific Northwest. This means lots of rain! </p>
    <p> This can cause some seasonal blues. I actually feel the opposite, I adore the rain. Its the reason we have these beautiful evergreen trees. </p>
    
    <h2 class="headings"> Hobbies</h2>
    <p> I enjoy love hiking, my home has canvases all around of my adventures. With my injury I have been limited. I will take advantage of my health </p>
    <p> when my i get all my movement back. I use ALLTRAILS to plan my adventures. Another hobby I do enjoy is reading. In construction my body is sometimes</p> 
    <p> so sleepy that I do not het the opportunity to read. This injury has the silver lining of time to read since I am required to rest so much. </p>
    <p> My favorite books are suspense novels and educational.</p>
